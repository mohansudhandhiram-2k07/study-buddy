 Features
 ( used for test but the real timer follows the pomodoro )

Custom Timer Modes: Cycle between "Focus" (12s), "Break" (5s), and "Deep Focus" (15s + 7s combo) using the Mode Button.

Start/Stop Control: A dedicated button to start, stop, or manually cancel any timer session.

RGB Status Lamp: A "breathing" RGB LED provides visual feedback:

Green: "Focus" or "Deep Focus" mode is active.

Blue: "Break" or "Deep Break" mode is active.

Off: The timer is idle.

Personality Engine: The OLED screen displays random motivational phrases during focus sessions and relaxing phrases during breaks.

OLED Status Display: Clearly shows the current mode and timer duration when idle, and personality phrases when active.

Automatic Flow: The "Deep Focus" mode automatically transitions from the study session to the break session.
